        <h2>About NutriData</h2>
        <p>NutriData was inspired by our love for healthy living, cooking and exploring new cuisines. We wanted to create a platform that
            makes it easy for food enthusiasts to discover, share recipes and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
            This project was developed as a portfolio project for Holberton School, where we honed our software engineering skills.</p>
